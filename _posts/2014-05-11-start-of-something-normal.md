For the longest time I've thought I should write down what goes in my head. Or at-least, document what I'm experimenting, reading or even one of those crazy shower ideas. It's not that I didn't try. Oh, I tried alright. I've tried _Blogger_, _Wordpress_ and more _Wordpress_ but the thought of logging in (even though my browser logs them for me) and writing in their editor sounded too much of a work. If you've not figured out already, then yes, I am one lazy guy but I've got a good excuse to say that. I'm a programmer and it just didn't feel right.

And then I heard about _pages_ from _github_. It sounded cool until I realize that it was just for static pages, of course you could commit your blog posts and it would appear as if it was a brand new posts but this too sounded too much of a work. Of course doing this is more work than signing up for a _Wordpress_ account but I still wanted to some control over and, well, _github_ did give me enough freedom to do so but it was a little overwhelming to be honest.

But the one thing that I've been overlooking all this time while browsing through the [pages.github.com][pages-github] was that it was using a [_Jekyll_][jekyll-official] engine, which has actually been for quite sometime (_spare me, I've been struggling with my life all these years and just getting in this field_). This was just what I needed, not bare-bones, not too high-level. The middle-ground. Umm, yes. I could almost smell the victory with this, or is that my laptop fan.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
 -->
<!-- {% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
