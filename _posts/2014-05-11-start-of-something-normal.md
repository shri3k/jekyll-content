For the longest time I've thought I should write down what goes in my head. Or at-least, document what I'm experimenting, reading or even one of those crazy shower ideas. It's not that I didn't try. Oh, I tried alright. I've tried _Blogger_, _Wordpress_ and more _Wordpress_ but the thought of logging in (even though my browser logs them for me) and writing in their editor sounded too much of a work. If you've not figured out already, then yes, I am one lazy guy but I've got a good excuse to say that. I'm a programmer and it just didn't feel right.

And then I heard about _pages_ from _github_. It sounded cool until I realize that it was just for static pages, of course you could commit your blog posts and it would appear as if it was a brand new posts but this too sounded too much of a work. Of course doing this is more work than signing up for a _Wordpress_ account but I still wanted to some control over and, well, _github_ did give me enough freedom to do so but it was a little overwhelming to be honest.

But the one thing that I've been overlooking all this time while browsing through the [pages.github.com][pages-github] was that it was using a [Jekyll][jekyll-official] engine, which has actually been for quite sometime (_spare me, I've been struggling with my life all these years and just getting in this field_). This was just what I needed, not bare-bones, not too high-level. The middle-ground. Umm, yes. I could almost smell the victory with this, or is that my laptop fan. 

Anyway, what I've decided doing is to use both _pages.github.com_ and _jekyll_ to run my blog. I've thought about using [heroku][heroku-official] as my host too but I don't see the reason to use _heroku_ when I already have _pages_. And I recommend you do the same if you want to start your own blog and are in the similar situation as I am. Seriously, there is no excuse these days not too. There are too many tools that's just ready for you to use. And if really really don't want to start your own blog then I've made this blog open source, user can send me pull request on the topic if they want to be published. Now, if that's not spoon feeding then I don't know what is. 

You can send me a pull request at this [project][blog-url] under \_posts directory with filename as `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-your-blog-title.md`. You're expected to know _markdown_ markup language. If you have no clue what that is then [here's a good starter][markdown-tut]. I'm using [kramdown] [kramdown-official] parser for my markdown so you might want to check that out too. Now, let us share the knowledge because as you know, it's the only way to grow them.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
 -->
<!-- {% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
