Funxtion is a utility tool that I created out of frustration to make any function in a file be able to execute from the cli without needing for the developer to create a seperate file just so s/he can test out his/her idea in node.
Although there are number of prototyping tools like [requirebin.com](http://requirebin.com), [c9.io](http://c9.io), [runnable](http://runable.com) and more, none of them felt faster, flexible and more native than running it locally on my computer. However, there was one caveat to this. I had to create a seperate file everytime just to quickly prototype some idea. This is not a big deal at first but as time goes by these zombie prototype files just starts piling up and starts producing clutter in my computer. I wish there was something like `Ctrl+Shift+J` in browser for client side JavaScript but for now I will settle with `funxtion`.  

Again, I can't emphasize this enough. This tool is highly for prototype only but if you do find some other usage of it then feel free to explore and experiment.  

You can find and read more about `funxtion` on the following links.
