#Imagine trying to build a skyscraper with just a wrench.

Think of us, devs, as construction workers. Let's just pretend for now that we're construction workers. You're given all these ideas and blueprints by architects and business folks and everything that's needed for construction. You are provided with all the possible resources that you can possibly think of to get this herculean task done but the problem is that you have no clue how to operate those big cranes, excavators, forklifts etc but you're an expert in using wrench. I'm not saying it's completely useless, well maybe to screw things when one of the nuts come lose in those bigger machinery but the point is you need to learn tools if you're even conceiving of making big web-apps. This doesn't just apply to web-apps. This applies to pretty much in all fields. So you, as a web-developer better know your tools well.

##DevTools
There are plenty of tutorials, tips and tricks on dev tools in the Internet and this one isn't going to be different either. I can't stress this enough. Learn to master *DEVTOOLS*. It might feel like I'm shoving it down your throat because I am. If you're going to be a decent developer then not knowing this should be a crime. I'll walk you through devtools in a scenario based events. I won't be giving out all the possible things that devtools can do because if I did then I might just point you to the devtool's `API` which are far more in-depth than mine can ever be and also far more updated. I will take a journey and then dig out the details in that way. I'll try my best to include journey both for latest Chrome and Firefox. With that said let's begin our journey.

##Opening devtools
The fastest way to get to the developer tools in either Chrome or Firefox is by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Sorry Mac users but I don't have Mac and I'm pretty sure the shortcuts presented here are similar except for the Ctrl which replaces with Cmd key). Some other might even prefer `F12` but I usually go for the former since F12 is much farther than those three keys. You can also go the old route of right clicking and selecting `Inspect Element` which will open up your devtools with `Element tab` being active and focusing on the element that was pointed to by your mouse (assuming that the mouse click is on your browser, duh). There are also other ways to open your devtools like going to the Settings -> Tools -> Developer Tools in Chrome or Tools -> Wev Developer -> Toggle Tools. 

##Changing Settings of devtools
Shortcut:-
_In Chrome only_
`?` or `F1`   
You have your devtools open and before you do anything I highly, highly recommend you change some of the settings first. I've seen many people never enter settings even after their heavy usage of devtools. There are some really powerful options available under that settings. All you have to do is press that `gear icon` on your devtools in Chrome and in Firefox or if you're in Chrome then you can just use the shortcut provided above. The options might be not at the exact place in Firefox and Chrome but if you read through some of them then it's not that hard to make connections between them. Not all options of one browser is guaranteed to be available in another so depending on what you want you might favor one for another. But that's a different topic on it's own let's just change some settings for now:-
+ Disable Cache _//this way your browser doesn't cache your js and css so that you can changes promptly after changes._  
_The following pertains only to Chrome DevTools_
+ Enable Ctrl + 1 - 9 shortcut to switch panels (self-explanatory which lets you jump to the tabs by pressing `Ctrl + [numeric key]`)
+ [Workspaces tab][#workspace_tab] _//if you want to live code on Chrome which is discussed later_
+ [Shortcuts][#shortcuts] _//Learn those shortcuts for maximum efficiency, also discussed later_
Got your settings all setup? Alright, let's start digging those hidden treasures that devtools has to offer.

##Console Tab
*Shortcuts:-*  
_In Firefox_  
`Ctrl + Shift + K` _//this will take you straight to the Web Console even if you're in devtools (You'll soon know why I mentioned this)_  
`Ctrl + Shift + J` _//this will only bring up the Web console window and nothing else._  

_In Chrome_  
`Ctrl + Shift + J` _//to jump straight to Web Console from your normal browser. Invoking this shortcut again in the devtools will open another devtools for your devtools. This will go as deep as your mind will let you._  
`Ctrl + 9` _//if you're already in devtools and has enabled `Ctrl 1-9 shortcut to switch panels` as mentioned above._
***
If you're a JavaScript developer then this will be one of the heaviest used tabs in devtools. So let's start from this tab. The console acts like an interpreter and display all the logging information. You can pretty much do your full programming here too (although not recommended). Go ahead and start writing your JavaScript expressions and start executing it (`Enter to execute`) and (`Shift + Enter`) to enter multi-line. Before we go full on on what this console has to offer take your time to right-click on the console and see what options it gives you.

_In Firefox_  
Right click will give you option to `log requests and response bodies`. What this means is it 

_In Chrome_
Right click will give you more options than Firefox although you're not losing any functionality per se. 
* Preserve the logs upon navigation  
  This does exactly what it says, if you're jumping over pages then instead of clearing the console on every new page it stores your earlier logs for you.
* Log XMLHttpRequest  
  This is to log your AJAX requests just in case if you ever needed that even though it's available in `Network tab`.

Okay okay no more transients. Diving deep in console now.
###Clear console
_Shortcut_
`Ctrl + L`  
_Alternatives_
* clear();
* Right click -> Clear console _In chrome_
* Clicking the clear icon in the devtools 
But the easiest way to clear the console is to just press `Ctrl + L`. That's it. You don't have to type `clear()` or right click and click `Clear Console` or find any obscure icons.
###Last Evaluated expression
$_  
Before you go there and start trying this thing out in your console make sure what expression is. Basically, expressions are any valid code that resolves to a value. According to MDN, there are two types of expressions. Those that assign a value to a variable and those that are simple value.  
So this:-  
`x = 1` would be first type expression and `1+1` would be second type expression. More on this [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators).  

So, doing `$_` should be pretty clear now that you understand what expression is. Again, `$_` will return the last evaluated expression in the console. To be honest, I don't use this as much. Pressing `up` arrow is far more easier than typing `$_`. But, just in case you need this then you know there's a way to do it.

###Last five DOM elements
`$0 - $4`
Say, you just inspected (right-click on website and select Inspect) something on your website and you want to grab that element. You could do `document.querySelector('some-class-or-id-or-tag')` but why waste time when you can just do `$0`. Do that again and the item that was stored in `$0` earlier will move to `$1` and so on till `$4`. It's not necessary that you have to inspect the element every-time from the website. You can simply select it on `Element Panel` if you already know where that element is and then use it on console with `$0`.

###Query Selectors
* $(selector)
* $$(selector)
* $x(path) 
####$(selector)
So, you know how to get the DOM elements using `$0 - $4` but let's say you have to find out the element with certain selector. You could inspect all the element in the site or even search (`Ctrl+F`) in `Element panel` but that's tedious. But wait, you know some JavaScript. So you can just do :-
* `document.getElementById('some-selector');` || 
* `document.querySelector('some-selector');` _//heads up this is not same as `document.getElementById()`
Orr, you could just use the alias to `document.querySelector('some-selector')` in devtools which is `$('some-selector')`

####$$(selector)
You try doing `$(selector)` but all you're getting is just one result. And then you realize that it's just doing what `document.querySelector()` was doing and sighed at yourself. Now you need something aliased to `document.querySelectorAll()`. And as you can already figure out from the heading that you can achieve just that by using `$$(selector)` and it will list out an array of all the elements with that selector.

####$x(path)
And if you happen to know [XPath](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath) then there's this `$x(path)` for you too.

###Events
* getEventListeners(object)
* monitorEvents(object, [events])
* unmonitorEvents( object, [events])



Besides above there's are lot of things that console API is capable of doing things that I'm not going to point out simply because the docs are much more better and also this API has slight variation on different browsers to listing them all out here will be ludicrous.
