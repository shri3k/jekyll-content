#Imagine trying to build a skyscraper with just a wrench.

Think of us, devs, as construction workers. Let's just pretend for now that we're construction workers. You're given all these ideas and blueprints by architects and business people and everything that's involved in construction. You are provided with all the needed resources that's needed to get this herculean task done but the problem is that you have no clue how to operate those big cranes, excavators, forklifts and other that's provided to you but say you're an expert in using wrench. I'm not saying it's completely useless, well maybe to screw things when one of the nuts come lose in those bigger machineries but the point is you need to learn tools if you're even conceiving of making big web-apps. This doesn't just apply to web-apps. This applies to pretty much in all fields. So you, as a web-developer better know your tools well.
