Primarily a web developer, but not afraid to venture into other fields as well.  I love the dynamicity of the web and that is why it is a no brainer for me to start this blog. 

Posted mostly weekly on the things I find interesting and useful for my fellow devs.

[Send a pull request] [github-repo] if you have something to share and I'll put them here.
